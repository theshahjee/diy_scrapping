        "transcription": " everybody is Beth I grab this pot holder from a local store as well as a sign from dollar general. The sign I removed the hanger from it and painted the center part with snow white chalk paint. After that was dry I took these half-round wooden beads, they're 12 millimeter I get them from Amazon. I placed them along the top in the bottom of the sign and use some tacky glue from Dollar Tree to adhere them. I just brushed them on the bottom of each one and then used my heating tool to dry that tacky glue make sure they were nice and stuck on there and then taped off the center and painted the rest of the sign with moss color chalk paint by Waverly. Next I cut around the image on the pot holder and remove that and then take mod podge and add a layer of that to that snow white chalk paint covering that entire section and then place down my image trying to get that circle as centered as possible by just eyeballing it and I just stretch that out and try to get those lines nice and straight and make sure it's covering all around that center. I smoothed it out with my hands I did dry that layer with my heating tool but I didn't get that on video. Once that was dry I did another layer of mod podge covering the top of that. And then I dry that layer completely with my heating tool. I then take my little sign and flip it upside down and just put something in the center of it so it's nice and flat and use my razor blade to cut off the excess fabric. And next I'm taking this little stand I had from a picture frame that I ever had removed from a previous craft and I just saw where I needed it to stand marked off where I needed to hot glue it added my hot glue and then place the metal part of that stand on there. And that is it for this project thank you so much for watching."

        "transcription": " This is how I transformed my home gym from this to this. I knew that I wanted to get pegboards to organize everything that we already had in the home gym, but I didn't know exactly what I was going to get. So when I was in Home Depot, I saw these individual 16 inch pegboards and realized that it had everything we needed to drill it into. They were super easy to install and relatively inexpensive. Now in order to organize the pegboards, I knew I would need some accessories. So I got these baskets again at Home Depot. There was a pegboard organizing kit, so that came with almost every hook I could possibly need. And yeah, I just got to work organizing and truly this is what made, well, it was one of the things that made the biggest difference in terms of like the aesthetic of the gym. Truly the organization alone, I probably could have just stopped there. It was enough for me. But naturally I didn't stop there. I started to paint a chalk wall and didn't realize until after that I got the wrong paint. Now to really drive home the message of you are in a gym in case anyone didn't know where they were when they were in this room. I did get some gym wall art from Etsy. It adds a little something to the room. Now this is when I got the paint. I was actually supposed to use and I did a few coats. We're just going to act like the other chalk paint that I was actually supposed to go on for. It was just a primer. Is everyone ready for a satisfying peel? Yeah, the other side did not look like that. Now I did get some liquid chalk markers in order to make this blackboard, you know. So inspirational. Soared today, strong tomorrow. Now at this point is when I realized I could not remember how to spell tomorrow. Not my best moment, but there we go. She got it eventually. No mud, no lotus. If you do not know this phrase, go look it up. Now the piece there is a stumps. The final touch. The thing that made the biggest difference in this gym. I put down these exercise mats that all fit together. First of all, it was very satisfying to get them all together, but honestly made the biggest difference. Okay, so the main reason why I've been setting this whole thing up is not only so that I can use it, but also just surprise my boyfriend. He's been gone for the last week and he knew I was doing something down here, but he didn't know what. Obviously we had some like gym equipment down here, but I really wanted to meet it. Like a very official gym area and organize a little bit. So do the column down these guys reaction. You're now allowed to come downstairs. Sleep. Sleep cool. Dang. This is great. Sleep. You don't even see that. Dang, you hung all of this up? Yeah. Are you excited too? It's cool, right? This is great. Is it okay? Yeah, I love it. Do you like the signs behind you? I can't know if we're putting this back. Where'd he go? This is the coolest part. Right? I know. It makes it a little bit more official, right? Yeah. Yeah. You got the chest now too. Yeah.

Now I've got some wood hanging around. I mean that woodwork as it is basically placed that on top of the bottle or the foam roller, but you can also add a little bit of wood to each end just as stoppers to make sure that you don't slip off. I'll show you how. There we go. Let's go try it out. This is just simply a balance board. Great for lateral strength, your legs and also your core. So here we go. The bottle hasn't popped yet."

That's where it sits in. It's got a comforting knees pins. Let's see how it works. This is like a triton so it could collapse. So it's actually pretty sturdy and it's only filled there with concrete. So if I want it more sturdier I just filled up with more concrete. I'll do it rough so you can see like this. This is still sturdy. It's like I've got no issue of putting 220 on that. I'll test it out but that's really firm. So obviously when you place it back on you know you know when it comes back it's still pretty sturdy man for a hundred dollars squat rack and it's portable. I can move these in or out. I can move them out of the way so we get the carry. So yeah I hope that gives you an idea and you make a rack and we can keep squatting."

        "transcription": " What's up everybody? In this video I've got an awesome rack attachment that's guaranteed to give you shoulder boulders. Oh yeah, we're doing a rack attached lateral raise. I got this idea from a video posted by Alex Good at the Sorenx facility. It's a fairly simple build. It only requires a few basic tools, but it's already become my favorite piece of gym equipment. As per usual, I'll show you a couple different design options to choose from. In this time, I'll throw in some modifications as well. Let's get started. Safety first. Wear a dust mask. Wear eye protection. Wear hearing protection. The IY projects are awesome, but being safe is even more awesome. The first option has a medium difficulty. It takes about an hour to an hour and a half to make and costs between $75 and $85. The first cut is the 2x6. I clamp this piece to my power rack, make sure it's level, and mark where the holes need to go. Next, I mark the 3 1-4 inch holes for the bearings. These holes are 3 inches from each side. To the left and to the right of each 3 1-4 inch hole are two smaller holes. I mark those and make sure everything is even and symmetrical before moving over to the drill press. My rack has 1 inch holes so I'm drilling holes with my 1 inch force in a bit. This can be modified if you have a rack with 5 8's holes. Next, I drill the holes for the bearings. Re-quarter inch holes for the center and quarter inch holes for the bolts to attach. After those are done, I cut the 2x4's. The length of these will depend on the length of your arms. I'm 5 7 and I cut my 2x4's to 16 inches. It's optional, but I round the edges with my router and a roundover bit. I need to drill a few holes into the 2x4. Each one needs 2 3 1-4 inch holes and a 3 8 inch hole. Here are the lengths of the boards and the whole sizes. Again, a lot of this is subjective. You can modify to fit your specific rack and body measurements. When I assemble, I put the bearings onto the 2x6 and secure them with 4 inch long bolts. Once those are tight, the 3 1 1-4 inch bolt goes in with the 2x4. In this case, the 6 inch bolt is not quite long enough. Rather than go back to the hardware store and buy a 7 inch bolt that trail out a slightly wider opening on the 2x4, this gives me enough room to secure the nut on the other side. The weight sleeves are made from dowels and carriage bolts. I had saturation to go from a previous project. The sleeve themselves are 6 1 1-1 1 2 inch long and happen to be perfect for this. If you haven't seen how I make these, I have a quick tutorial to show you how it's done. The arm pads are made from a 3 1 2 1-1 \u00bc inch threaded rod cut into 12 inch pieces. I already had these cut, too, but here's some stock footage to show you how it's done. Insert the rod into the 2x4 and put the pad on the rod. The nuts are used as spacers and the washers help keep the pad in place. Now we're good to go. A load it up and it works like a charm. The second option is easier to make. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour and costs between $125 and $135. I attached a 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and a weight sleeve on the other side. The weight sleeve is attached with 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 on the end and move onto the next one. After that the rest of the steps are the same. When I put this on my rack I use a 1 inch thick bolt on top and 7 8's on the bottom. I find it's easier to install and remove this way. This one looks good and feels identical. Now let's cover questions and comments from Instagram and TikTok. Resistance is zero at the bottom and 100% at the top. It's not horrible and you can still get a good pump but there are ways to increase resistance at the bottom. The easiest option is to add bands and it's a burn. The awesome thing about using bands is they provide so many different options. You can use long bands, short bands, thin bands, thick bands and they all provide different resistance. Another option is to change weight pin placement or add an additional pin. This modification took about 30 minutes and made a huge difference. These are the pieces I added to each side. I threw this together real quick using pocket holes. For longevity I'd suggest reinforcing the joints with mending plates. Can it be modified to have multiple functions? Yes. It took a minute to figure out the right way to do it and to be honest it is kind of a pain in the butt to set up. But I did get it to work as a leg extension and leg curl. It actually felt pretty good. Now there may be a better way to set it up. I don't know. I've already got a machine for this so I didn't want to spend too much time on it. Can you add handles? Yes. You can easily add handles by adding a 45 degree elbow and a 6 inch piece of pipe. If you're looking for longer handles, I've got you covered. Disassemble a 2 inch caster, drill a quarter inch hole into the pipe. Fasten the caster base onto the 2x4, attach the pipe at the 45 degree elbow and the 6 inch pipe. Boom! Can you make it adjustable for multiple people to use? Yes. In this case, the first design is actually better. You can add multiple holes and move the pads and wheat sleeves around to accommodate different arm lengths and change the weight distribution. That being said, both designs can easily move up and down the rack. Why not just use dumbbells? Sure. If you have dumbbells, you can use those instead. Some people may not have this space for a full set of dumbbells or the cache. This thing is small and costs a lot less than a full set of dumbbells. It was also brought to my attention that this is a good option for people with wrist pain, hand injuries or amputations. Oh, we got one more. What is it? Don't like his hers voice. I'm out. Okay, cool. Peace out, bro. As always, thanks for watching. Be sure to check out my other videos, follow on Instagram and TikTok and tag me in your DIY gym builds. I love to see those."

        "transcription": " Hey, what's up, guys? Jose here, shreddeddad.com. In today's video, I'm going to show you how to make a DIY leg press. Now you can do this for about 30 bucks. So, what you're going to need is a set of rings, just like this. I'm assuming you already have a home gym if you're watching this. So what we're going to do is we're going to hang the rings from the pull-up bar on top. Then we're going to have a bench behind us. I have it at about 45 degrees. We're going to need a barbell and then some weights. So we're going to go ahead and set that up. Now, already have the rings set up to make it easier to make it faster for the video. And all I'm going to do now is I'm going to add the bar. And the bar over here, you're going to insert the bar through the rings. You're going to make sure that the rings are sitting right about the same area on both ends. Then we're going to go ahead and add the weights to this. There we go. Now what we're going to do is you're going to come behind the bar here. You're going to push it forward so that your legs are right on it. And then all you have to do is make sure you space them out evenly. And then you're going to go ahead and do your press. So just press forward, come back down. And of course, if you want to add more weight to this, you can. But it's very stable. It doesn't slip on your feet. Of course, when you're where, whatever shoes you're wearing, you want to make sure they're not slippery. But as long as you keep your feet around the knurling on the bar, you should be okay. But there you have it guys. That's the your DIY leg press. What I'm going to do is I'm going to leave a link right below this video. So you can check out the rings that I'm using here. Very cheap on their 30 bucks. And if you already have the other equipment, all you have to do is add the rings to a pull-up bar. Put the bench behind you and you're ready to go. Hope you like the information in this video. If you liked it, give it a thumbs up. Leave me your comments and questions down below. And don't forget to subscribe to the channel. Take care."

        "transcription": " What's up guys, welcome to this week's Home Gymhack, the most improvised home gymhack that we have done so far. Now to preface things, rowers are expensive, rowers can be fun, they're a great tool for conditioning, but not everybody has the budget or the space to add a rower into their setups. So today we're going to go digging in the kids toy closets so that we can improvise the DIY rower. Check it out. So I want you to pay real close attention here because there are a few different things that we're going to need for the setup. The first thing being a heavier set of dumbbells. Now this is going to be like our foot anchor that we're going to be able to push off and onto during the movement. So I want one dumbbell perpendicular with the rack upright and then the other dumbbell we're going to create essentially our foot plate for the actual movement. So once we have our dumbbell set up, now when we're pulling off of the rack our feet are set and it's not going to cause any extra force to pull the rack out and away from the wall. So next step we are going to get our bottom resistance. I'm going to go with the black mobility band. Obviously the higher you go on the mobility band the more the tension is going to be. Now listen closely. This mobility band is going to be attached to the bottom of our seat which happens to be a skateboarder today. So we're going to put this around the axle of our skateboard so that we're pushing back and forth, back and forth during the roller exercise. We have that tension bringing us back in to go back for our next pull. So lastly any kind of wooden dowel for our handle works. I'm actually just going to use a like a recovery roller for your legs. What have you? This is going to serve as my roller handle and then my main source of resistance that's going to go around the bottom of the rack is a red mobility band. So this is going to do it. I'm just like that. We're going to center it up on our handle whatever you choose to be a handle and then we're going to plant ourselves in the middle of the skateboard and we're going to be able to perform the DIY roller. Now as you can see the black mobility band is pulling me back and then I need to not only pull but I need to push against both mobility bands, activating both the lower and other body. Now guys you're probably thinking well this isn't relatable to a roller at all. How am I supposed to get the same workout as roller? It's not going to be 100% comparable to hop popping on an actual Concept 2 roller. But in the garage gym we find different ways to do different movements. This just happens to be the PRX version of the Concept 2 roller. If you do not have the budget or the space to add one into your garage. Thanks for watching, I'm Jim Hanks, we'll see you next time."

        "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ThisOldHouse/videos/turn-a-storage-room-into-a-modern-home-gym/353443736312570/",
        "transcription": " Hi I'm Jen from House One and today I'm showing how I turned an unfinished storage room into a home gym. With two little ones running around my husband and I always have trouble getting to the gym. So this year we are dedicated to creating a space inside of our home. The trouble is the only really unused space we have is an unfinished storage room in our basement. Now I knew I wanted to conceal the storage behind closet doors but I was pretty worried that I was going to make a small space feel even smaller. So I opted to use mirrored bypass doors to hopefully reflect light back into the room and make it feel a little larger. To get started I first framed out the wall with two by fours with an opening wide enough for the two sets of bypass doors. Without a center divider the doors can open to the sides or off to one side. I also elevated the opening to accommodate base board for a more built in look. I secured the framing to the concrete floor, center block exterior wall, wood framed interior wall and the joists above. I framed the opening with one by and installed the track and then the doors. Once I got the mirrors installed I realized they did make the room feel bigger but they felt a little builder grade. So I started brainstorming ways to make them feel a little more high end. While I was thinking that through I decided it was time to paint the back wall. Now since it's a center block wall I used a waterproofing sealer with a high nap roller to seal the surface and to smooth out the rough texture. We don't really get a lot of moisture in our basement but painting this wall really made the room feel a bit more like a finished space already. Having said that this stuff goes on really thick and I almost used a whole gallon for just this one wall. Now looking back at the doors I realized that the white frames and the metal valence along the top of the doors was not the custom look that I was after. So this is when I decided to replace the valence with a wood arch and paint the mere doors. To replace the valence I started with a 1x8 board and tacked nails into it to curve a scrap piece of wood into an arch shape. I traced the shape and then cut it using a jigsaw. I glued a nailed 1 1.4 inch thick piece of trim to finish the cut edge and drilled pocket holes into the backside for installation. Next I brought the mirrors back up into the shop for paint. Now as I was prepping them I did realize that there was a film of plastic on the metal frames that I first had to remove before I could scuff see them. I don't know if this is true of all metal frames around these types of mirrors but it did take me quite a bit of time and was unexpected. Once that was removed I was able to scuff see on the metal and prep it for paint. Now painting a mirror can be really difficult because if you don't get a crisp line along the edge of the mirror it can look pretty sloppy since it's reflected back in the mirror. So I opted to tape off the main part of the mirror but then use what's called a masking film around the edges. The gel is applied in one thick coat with a paint brush. Once it dried I could spray the frames with a spray paint designed for metal surfaces in matte black. After two coats of paint I scored the inner edge of the frame with a utility knife and peeled back the masking gel and plastic. After the first two doors were complete I knew I was on the right track. What a difference. It was now time to turn my attention to the other main walls in the space. Now I knew I wanted to do something that had warm wood tones since I wouldn't be using wood on the floor in the space. And I've used laminate roll vinyl in the past and had great success on smaller projects. But I was a little bit worried about trying to smooth out any wrinkles and secure it to a large wall. So I opted to use laminate to click together planks instead because I knew that I could still glue these to the wall but also nail them in place and they would be a little bit more secure. The boards are about a quarter inch thick and click together along the length but also at their ends. So it was important to make sure that I started cutting from the right end of the board to start each row and end each row. I marked my studs and started the first row about six inches off the floor so I wouldn't waste an entire course behind the base board. In hindsight this was pretty difficult to level and I probably should have just started at the floor but I'm frugal so I just took the extra time to level this row perfectly. I used construction adhesive to secure the planks and pin nails to face nail them to the studs without creating visible holes that needed to be filled. As I continued up the wall I removed the outlet cover marked the location of the plug and then used a jigsaw to notch out the opening. To add the second row the boards have to tilt into the groove. My best advice is to tack the end of the first board in place, snap the joints of the ends of the boards together and then tap the board down to lock it in place. I continued up the wall gluing every couple courses and nailing each board in place. On the final section of the wall I cut out the dry wall between the studs to make space for some inset shelves. I finished up that wall and then headed to the shop to build the boxes for the shelves and coat them with paint. While I was there I also coated the base board and trim as well. To install the base board on the walls with wood framing I used adhesive and nails. On the center block wall I used adhesive only. I used a piece of the rubber flooring as a spacer to raise the base boards off the floor. Now I could position the wall shelves in the opening, secure them to the studs on either side and then trim around their edges for an inset look. With the main components of this room complete it was time to add some lighting. Now I knew I loved the look of indirect LED lighting but most of it that I found was pretty expensive. So I decided to make my own by sticking a strip of lighting to the back of the board and then installing it on the wall. With a block at the top and bottom to hold it away from the wall. This created the glow I was after without the price tag. I also added an industrial light on the ceiling to shine more light around the room and really brighten up the space. For the flooring I reached out to a company called US rubber. They make a rubber floor tile that's 94% recycled rubber and mainly comes from truck tires that might have otherwise ended up in a landfill. Their products come in a ton of color combinations and you can also pick the size of the color chip and create a custom color. I specifically chose their eco lock tile in all black for a sleek look and because it comes with removable border edges. So I don't have to cut the tabs off of all the perimeter tiles which will save me a ton of time. For my installation I knew my space was 6.5 tiles wide by 8.5 tiles long. So I just started at the corner of the room and worked my way outward. But if you're working in a larger space you'll want to start in the center of the room and work your way out in quadrants. The tiles have tabs that nest tightly together and I found it easiest to bend in the corners of the tab and tuck them together. I tried to rubber mail it but the tuck method just worked better for me. Once I got to the mirror wall I cut the tiles to size using a straight edge and a utility knife. I scored the tile several times with the blade and then separated the parts. The hardest part was cutting the tile along the angled wall but luckily I had a few extra tiles on hand in case I messed up. At this point I loved how the room was coming together but the back wall was pretty plain so I created some interest by gluing and nailing the leftover wood planks to a piece of plywood and then added an open planter box at the base. I filled the planter with some faux snake plants to bring in a little color before hanging the piece on the wall with French cleats. And with that our new home gym was complete. I hope you enjoyed this project. For more easy woodworking projects and room makeovers visit the House One Channel on thistlethouse.com.

So I decided to make my own by sticking a strip of lighting to the back of the board and then installing it on the wall. With a block at the top and bottom to hold it away from the wall. This created the glow I was after without the price tag. I also added an industrial light on the ceiling to shine more light around the room and really brighten up the space. For the flooring I reached out to a company called US rubber. They make a rubber floor tile that's 94% recycled rubber and mainly comes from truck tires that might have otherwise ended up in a landfill. Their products come in a ton of color combinations and you can also pick the size of the color chip and create a custom color. I specifically chose their eco lock tile in all black for a sleek look and because it comes with removable border edges. So I don't have to cut the tabs off of all the perimeter tiles which will save me a ton of time. For my installation I knew my space was 6.5 tiles wide by 8.5 tiles long. So I just started at the corner of the room and worked my way outward. But if you're working in a larger space you'll want to start in the center of the room and work your way out in quadrants. The tiles have tabs that nest tightly together and I found it easiest to bend in the corners of the tab and tuck them together. I tried to rubber mail it but the tuck method just worked better for me. Once I got to the mirror wall I cut the tiles to size using a straight edge and a utility knife. I scored the tile several times with the blade and then separated the parts. The hardest part was cutting the tile along the angled wall but luckily I had a few extra tiles on hand in case I messed up. At this point I loved how the room was coming together but the back wall was pretty plain so I created some interest by gluing and nailing the leftover wood planks to a piece of plywood and then added an open planter box at the base. I filled the planter with some faux snake plants to bring in a little color before hanging the piece on the wall with French cleats. And with that our new home gym was complete. I hope you enjoyed this project. For more easy woodworking projects and room makeovers visit the House One Channel on thistlethouse.com.

        "transcription": " So today we're building a home gym out of walnut plywood. I've been cutting out the pieces for this project using my CNC machine, but you absolutely could do this with a jigsaw and a palm router. I cut out a few different profiles for the dip bar because I wanted a socket for a cross support and I wanted some overlap right above the right angled joint. With how strong this plywood is I probably could have gotten away with just two layers, but three has a nice thick hand feel. I glued the three layers together and then routed in sanded de edges. The cross support sockets in nice and tight, so I felt that glue would be strong enough to hold it together here. If I was going all jigsaw and router though, I probably wouldn't have socketed this. I just would have used my Craig jig to do some pocket holes. If I was building this for a client other than myself, I'd probably use real walnut plugs here, but for my own use I'm perfectly okay with finished screws and the little wood putty over the top. For the bag holder I want to have a lot of strength where the device meets the French cleat and that's because the cross bar that holds the bag is removable so I'm not getting extra rigidity there. I feel exposed pocket holes in a few different ways, but I'm really lazy to just use wood putty. Sometimes I put in dowels and then just flush trim them, but this time I just cut another panel and I'm just gluing it on to cover up the pocket holes. Using a water-based polyurethane as a finish and I went with two coats with a light sanding of 400 grit sandpaper in between. The best reason to go with three layers here instead of just two would be just to add more wood around the eyeball, but again I'm not exactly a heavyweight so I think this should be good. I watched quite a few YouTube videos on how to fill a punching bag. Here's what I came up with. Cutting and taping together circles of cardboard help give the bag shape at the top and the bottom. I cut circles that were about two inches smaller in diameter than the inside of the bag itself. The heavier the bag is the less it'll swing so I filled up some plastic shopping bags with nice clean sand, made sure it was dry so I don't get any mold or mildew inside and then kept adding layers of additional plastic bags and tape. These about 15 pounds of sand oriented towards the bottom of the punching bag. I typically save old clothes to use as shop rags and a punching bag is really just a weighted bag full of rags. I washed all this discarded clothing, made sure it was completely dry, cut out any zippers, buttons or pieces of metal that were attached to it and also just cut them up into relatively small pieces so that I could get a nice even stuffing. I was really surprised about the amount of rags that it took to fill this bag and that's because I compacted them pretty tight. I'd add about six to eight inches of rags and then use a stick to poke them down and try to keep it nice and even. I added another circle of cardboard near the top with plenty of rags around its edges and just over the top of that. I then laced it all up. Alright, let's get to the testing. I weigh 170 pounds and typically I never do weighted pull ups with more than a 45 pound plate but when I tease this project on Instagram there is a lot of people telling me that this would break with anything over 200 pounds. Honestly I don't know how much weight to think and support but I have a suspicion that it's going to be a lot stronger than I am. Watch for deflection under 240 pounds. Alright, feel free to critique the form in the comment section below. Yeah, I chained it quite go high enough. It moved a little bit but I still feel my form is going to fall there before the plywood. Add it on a 10 pound plate to bring the total of 250 and still no problems with the plight. So I probably have two more videos left in this series. One more where I make the bench which will be used for the workouts themselves and probably show you in that one how I make some kind of creative weights. And then the final video will be installing it in my new house which is the quick update. We're finally getting the window so we should be able to complete construction on that relatively soon. So we'll do a final sort of install video in its final location and give you the tour and then I'll show you my sort of typical workouts that I do on a typical week."

        "transcription": " This is my multifunctional coat closet. I've got coats but I've also got craft supplies and miscellaneous electronics batteries you name it. Most builders installed the coat rod at 66 inches, which is too low. It doesn't leave enough space for any organizers underneath and you can't really access the stuff on top. So I decided to remove mine and move it higher. I actually mounted mine at 76 inches. This is a much better height because you can still access the stuff on top with the door frame but you can get a nice size organizer in there too. I had a lot of fun organizing my kids craft supplies. I used spice jar holders for the paints. So the easiest way to create more space is to raise the clothes bar."

        "transcription": " My friend Freina desperately needs some help to organize a small two functional closet. Did you know Ikea has this new closet organizer? I'm using the Ikea Artil system to transform this small region closet. This is a really easy organizer to install. It's actually cheaper than the Ikea Pax wardrobe and it makes a great impact for organizing any small closet. We're going to get started on the closet first because she desperately needs some organization in here. First up is always to clean out and be the closet and take inventory of what you're going to keep and what you're going to discard. Okay now the closet is empty now. I'm going to take this shelf lock, remove this bar, but yeah we want to start with like a total blank slate in this closet. Next up let's patch the holes and give it a quick coat of paint before we get to installing the new organ either. When you're beginning to look closet organized we just want to make sure the depth is going to match the depth of your closet. The first thing I noticed as I open this is that this is a one person installation so this is going to be so easy for me. Okay so then we're just going to put the leg on first. What's cool about the mounting bracket is that there's so many holes in it so you can just install this into any hole wherever the studs line up. So I'm at this stage where I'm ready to install the drawers and the shelves and I'm actually having a hard time figuring out where they go. So for the Ikea Pax wardrobe you like plan it out and it tells you like which holes to put everything in. I thought the Audra was the same but it's not so this is kind of what I figured out. So I'm going to build from the bottom up and it's going to go six holes from the bottom up and then in between each of the brackets or the slides you can go nine holes in between. We're building three drawers for this closet system so these are the odd roll doors and I think they're a really good size for light soft underwear, a t-shirt, that kind of thing. So the hanging rods that come with the Audra organizer they actually need a minimum of 68 inches long of a closet. You can't cut them down to size because they're adjustable. So I'm going to have to get some wood rods. So I cut down my dowel. These are the brackets I got. Guys check this out this organizer is done isn't this amazing I love this as such a budget price. It's going to be so much more functional for free now in our family. I think this would be great for any kids room, a coat closet or even a linen closet. It just adds a ton of storage at a really budget price and it was so easy to install. Make sure you like and subscribe this video and I'll see you next time for more budget DIYs."

        "transcription": " Hey guys, welcome back to my channel for another makeover. Today we are finally tackling our oldest suns bedroom. We figured it was about time since we've lived in our house for well over a year now. You guys know how that goes. The time just gets away from you. But as you can see, we are starting with a pretty blank slate. We actually painted the walls of his bedroom this off-white color about a month or so after moving in because originally they looked like this. Very girly, very bright, very turquoise, complete with Louis Vuitton logos on the wall. So we have made some progress in the space since moving in. But today we are going to be customizing this to our sun, Luke's style and interest, which just happens to be football and the NFL chief's team. So I'm going to be adding some function into this bedroom and making this space that represents him as well as give him a space that he can relax in and enjoy for years to come. And we are doing this all on a budget. As usual, I'm going to be sharing a few tips throughout the video. But to start out, we are going to be painting this back wall to bring some focus into the bed area and also ground the space just a bit. Nothing out there could ever stop me. I'm going to be painting this back wall to bring some focus into the bed area. Let me know if you guessed the color that we are going with in this room. This color that we chose is Hail Navy by Benjamin Moore. And we actually use this color in our theater room upstairs. And I love it because it gives a very subtle color while still keeping things neutral and also very versatile so that we can still kind of play around with the core and not worry so much about clashing with the paint color. If you've been here for a while, you might remember that we also use a very similar color to this in our basement in our Utah home. That one was bare poppy seed. And we loved that one too. It was just slightly different. Maybe a little bit less navy color to that one. But we have honestly shared so many different makeovers on this channel. So if you haven't caught yourself up on them all, be sure to check out my makeover playlist. There are lots of different design styles, lots of different room spaces, and different homes even. So if you enjoy makeovers, you will definitely want to get all cut up on what we've done over the years. And stay tuned because in just a few days we will be sharing our middle suns bedroom makeover as well. And then next week we are sharing our youngest suns bedroom makeovers. They are all going to be totally different from each other. So lots of fun things to come. Be sure you're subscribed if you're not already. So you don't miss out. And if you have seen some of the other makeovers, comment below and let me know which of them have been your favorites. All right, Kyle just got back from the store to get some electrical things. We are making a tiny little bit of progress. But honestly, once I trim everything out, it will go really fast. Especially we're only doing this one wall and the only tricky parts are just the windows. So I'm going to go ahead and finish trimming this out, then roll it on. And while I'm doing that, Kyle is going to finish getting things ready to start replacing this fan. This is just like an older fan. So we're actually going to replace it with the same style that we've done throughout the rest of the house. And we are also replacing the chandelier. Finally, the rooms that the boys moved into originally were all girls' rooms. If you remember the video forever ago. But originally it was like a teal color with Louis Vuitton decals on the wall. And they had the chandelier in here. So we haven't messed with the electrical just until we're ready to put the light up. We do have like a really fun light to put in here. And then yeah, the fan. And I'll just continue painting. But this room is like night and day from what it started out. Let me first move in. Yeah. Learning to cut in has saved me hours of time. And it's also saved our budget from not having to buy lots and lots of painters tape every single time we painted room. Which has honestly been a lot lately. But I also wanted to mention over the years we have found it really is worth it to get high quality paint. It will save you a lot of time from not having to do extra coats. And it will also save you money because without having to do extra coats it's going to save you paint. So a good rule of thumb to keep in mind typically when shopping for paint is the less coverage area a paint can gives you the thicker the paint is. And typically the higher quality it is. So for example, the paint that we are using is from Benjamin Moore. It has a smaller coverage area. But we only have to put on about one to two coats. And previous paints that we've used will have a thinner consistency. But a larger coverage area. And when we've used those paints we've ended up having to put on about three to four coats of paint. Now this is something that definitely varies depending on the paint sheen, the color you're painting over or the color that you're painting on. But generally speaking these are just some tips that we've learned. All right, I got the first coat on and some of the trim area I have two coats on. So we're very very close to being done painting. Kyle is going to call me. He's going to turn off the electricity. And then we're going to start tackling like the fan everything while the paint dries. All right, so let me know when the lights go off. Okay. Nope. Oh yeah, that's him. It's off. Yep. Whenever we do makeovers like these we always try to look at every aspect of the room and not just focus on like the more obvious ones. But instead we look at things that are going to make a big impact or like those small details. For example, things like changing out the lighting, changing up this fan that we're doing right here, also changing outdoor handles or you know those little tiny touches. Those are sometimes the things that are going to set your space apart and really make it look very custom. We've definitely done this a few times so it doesn't typically take us a whole long time to tag team things like this and just knock it out quickly. As long as no unexpected hiccups arise, which as you know, they always pop up. Like I do not know if we've done a makeover or other house projects where we haven't had hiccups come up. I feel like it's just inevitable. Something is going to go a little bit wrong and make you spend a lot of extra time doing something so silly. If you're following us over on our vlog channel, the Kylin Amanda channel, you know exactly what I'm talking about already. But if you don't follow us over there, then stay tuned and you will find out it's been going on shortly. Smile! You're on Candy Camera. Candy Camera? Oh yeah, I forget it's called Candid Camera. Did you think it was Candy Camera? Yeah. I forgot about that. You're on Candy Camera. I never understood it. Candid. I'm sorry I didn't forget about that. You are goofy on manners. Felix, what are you doing? Just checking out under the cushions or under the quilt. Oh my goodness. I love it. So here Kylin is just changing all the light switches to make them a bit more compatible with the new fan. And also he's just kind of rearranging the order since we have had new lighting installed in the bedroom since moving in. He's just setting it up in a way that kind of makes more sense for the room. This is not any kind of like crazy elect co-work. It's pretty simple or at least that's what Kylin tells me, but he has done this so many times. So what could go wrong? All right. All right. It is a few days later. We actually had to cut filming short the other day because when Kylin was putting in the ceiling fan, we ran into a little electrical issue and we got it all sorted out, but Kylin could explain exactly what happened a little bit better than me. I just wanted to be known, not my fault, although I was super worried. So we put three new switches in the box here and we put the new fan on. And I go down and turn the breaker on and sparks just came flying out of this box. One time there was like a puff of like smoke. Yeah, puff of smoke and sparks. And then obviously the breaker flip and I was like, oh man, like I really screwed up. But what really happened was there's this plastic box and they put a screw through the back to attach to the wood and they pinch the cable back there and the screw went through the middle of the wires. So when I move the switches around, it just made contact and shorted out the box. So it wasn't my fault, which I'm happy about. And luckily the switches survived and the fans survived. Yeah. So we're good to go, but that's what happened here. We were joking like we entered the hiccups zone, like the pilot zone, but any of you house projects at hiccups and you can't even like expect them, even when you're like like we're expecting a hiccup, but you can never. Yeah, like we were so careful. Make sure we had everything we need to make sure all that stuff. Like there's a screw through one of the wires. Yeah. Like how would you ever predict that? Like you like rewire the fan, rewire this. You're like everything is done correctly. I don't know what's going on. Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't my fault. That's all I cared about. I was like, did I do something? I'm not a difficult. Yeah. So I'm just glad it wasn't me. It was somebody else, but we didn't, I didn't mess with that at all. That was beyond my like I can do basic stuff, but I was like, let's call him electrician because when you get to sparks line out of there, then yeah, then I'm done. I'll call somebody. Yeah. So originally on day one, we were also planning to take out Luke's gorgeous chandelier that he's been hanging out with for like a year, almost a half. But once we ran into that electrical issue, we were like, we don't even want to start with like this electricity stuff. And anyway, so we are going to add this little moonlight in. It's super cool. And then we are going to finish everything up. We have some book shelves to build. We have a desk to build. All the decor and everything like to kind of style it in here. So we are getting a little bit of a later start today. So we're going to go ahead and jump right on into things. We always tease Luke about the chandelier asking if he'll miss it when it goes away and no surprise. He has not missed it yet. But the moonlight ended up being so cool. I will link it down below. We actually ordered it months and months ago, like shortly after moving in, we've just been hanging out with it until we did their makeovers. But I cannot wait for y'all to see how it turns out. Funny story. They're ended up being a big hiccup with this moonlight as well. Now we didn't end up showing that part in this video. But we did vlog about it over on our vlogging channel called Kyle and Amanda. And the vlog channel is also linked down below if you aren't already subscribed over there. But over there, we just share a lot more behind the scenes and more personal things on that channel. And wait for sparks. And dim it. Actually, that looks really cool. Oh, that looks super cool. Actually, that looks awesome, doesn't it? I think that's awesome. That looks super cool. Especially at night when it's dark in here. Yeah, that'll look awesome. Wow. I love it. Actually, that turned out so much better than I thought. Yeah. All right. Now that we finally have the light working, all the electrical stuff. The wall is painted. We have some things to build. We're going to building some bookshelves and a little desk. But we have to go ahead and do like the curtain rod. We have to DIY that. And also like spray paint just a few things. One of the things is going to be their little like door knob things for their closet door. And then like a couple hooks. So we're going to go ahead and grab anything that we need to paint so we can get that painted and just kind of let that care in the sun for a little bit while we're doing other things. Let's head outside. Be what you want to be. Do what you want to do. And if it sets you free. Believe in only you. Yesterday is gone. Forget about tomorrow and the sea lands you see right through. We have been doing our DIY curtain rods for years now. And we have shared it so many times and all of our other makeovers. So if you are not familiar with it, if you're new to the channel and you haven't heard me talk about it, go ahead and check out some of our other makeovers. Like the farmhouse makeover series or the rustic makeover series or the boho makeover series. Those all are going to have detailed directions on how to do this. But these DIY curtain rods are incredible because you end up with a super sturdy, very high end looking curtain rod for under $15 each. If you watch my makeover videos or house projects videos like ever, you know that I love to spray paint things and just give them new life or give them a totally new style or feel. And my biggest tip for spray painting is to do several light coats and then you want to allow them to dry between each coat. This will help you get full coverage and avoid any drips. Also in all of the years that I have been spray painting things, this has been my top favorite brand of spray paint. It goes on almost any type of surface and it's super high quality. . Find the moment in making. Right your head line and raise it to the sky. No one else can create it. Take your banner and raise it to the sky. It's just a question. Would you just? No. Can I just smash it? No, please don't. I mean, please don't smash it. I can tell it. No, you know the way things go before. There's only reason I'm not doing it right now but it does make sense so this is how it should go. You're learning. I'm glad. So here we were just putting together two bookshelves that will attach to the wall and I'm going to put them on either side of the bed. They'll end up acting as side tables but they'll also bring your eye up, helping the ceiling to feel taller and it also is going to give them the freedom to change up. What he keeps on them as his taste and style may change as he gets older. Which I love doing things like that where it really makes these makeovers not just something that's going to last a year or two but something that can really grow with him. It just makes things a lot more easy to manage and also keeps it in the budget instead of having to redo things because your child no longer kind of fits into the space that you created for them. And I thought it was a really unique addition to his room instead of just doing the typical side tables next to his bed. And I also just wanted to point out that in this particular bookshelf I put everything together correctly. And in fact I almost caught Kyle putting something together backwards. So I am currently trying to coin the phrase pulling a Kyle as meaning messing up on building furniture. He is definitely not going along with it. He's still thinks that's more like pulling an Amanda. But I think I'll still give him a hard time about that for a while. We are going to be working on the boys' closets another day. But today I'm just vacuuming out a small area and I'm going to put Luke's old queue organizer in the closet and just give him a little organization in there until we figure out a better solution. And I'm also moving it in the closet to make room in his bedroom for his new desk that we will be building in just a minute. So at the moment Luke is doing most of his schoolwork at our kitchen table. But as he gets older and gets into higher grades I know that a desk is going to be very useful for him. And I searched and searched on Facebook Marketplace for one. But all the ones I could find weren't in good shape or they were the price of a new one. So I ended up finding this one at Target when they were having a sale on all their furniture and it ended up working out so super great in this bedroom. And this is actually the same desk that I use in my sisters budget boho makeover series. But I just use a different stain color in her room. But I love it so much and I just love how modern and simple it looks. Okay, so this area was actually going to have something totally different above the desk. Luke and I had been looking on Etsy months ago for things for his bedroom. And he found a picture that he loved of a few of his favorite Kansas City Chiefs players. But to get it in the size that we were going to need it was going to be well over $100 just for that one picture. And the thing about that is there's never going to be a separate use for something like that. So instead I grabbed this canvas from Hobby Lobby that was on sale for about $12 along with a wooden hook that I already had. And his Chiefs jersey that we also already had. And I put it on one of Kyle's wooden hangers and voila he has perfect decorations above his desk that cost us next to nothing. And the best part is he can now pull his jersey down when he wants to wear it. But when he's not wearing it, it's not just shoved in his closet or in his drawers. Instead it's being able to add to his room and it's something that he can look at every day. I just ended up loving this area of his room. And I feel like it ended up turning out better than the other way would have. And I also love that it was done on a tiny budget. We make out for Philly Vitt mess around for the Philly Vitt. Don't stop y'all never let this be. What is Philly Vitt making every no regret? I remember making a lot of progress. We have big stuff done but we still need to put up the curtains and decorate like on here. Of course do the bedding and everything. But everything was everywhere. So I just let them kind of empty out the space. Kyle is actually working going to work on Dornocks. They're super cool. They're really neat. We ordered them off Amazon. They're just really clean, like hardy Dornocks and their matte blacks will match the ones that we're going to do in here. But they're really substantial. They're really heavy. It just might end up being a bigger job than like quickly switching out Dornocks. Right. It's going to be a fairly big job. So I wonder if we could save that for like a home projects video or something. We'll probably do that another day. But I am so excited. These look so cool looking. I don't know if this is your guys' style. This is like 100% our style. We just love the modern sleep look. And they're super heavy. They're really neat. We'll do it another time. It's not going to be a huge deal. They'll still have the gold on their handles for now. But the closet will be done. And then this way if we're not having to router out the door and all these different things, then we can get everything done tonight. Yeah, we're just thinking about it. Yeah. So to hang up our DIY curtain rod that we cut and painted earlier, you're just going to cut two strips of leather and drill a screw into the top section of it, creating a loop, and then measure where you want them to go. We put ours all the way up to the top of the ceiling. And then we make the curtain rod go about 10 to 12 inches outside of the window frame and then drill it in. And then once your straps are attached to the wall, you just slide the middle pipe into the loops. And now you have a super nice DIY curtain rod on a budget. It is incredible to me what a difference curtains can make, especially when you bring them all the way up to the ceiling. It just makes the room feel so much taller and bigger. And then also just really like kind of softens the space and love it so much. So now it's like we have a lot of heavy lifting done. Really, we just need to style these bookshelves and then also go ahead and tackle his bedding. Yeah. One of the big parts of Luke's shelf decor was some prints that I found on Amazon, as well as some pictures I ordered as digital downloads and printed myself at Walgreens. And then I just stuck them in these $2 frames from Walmart. This is a great budget saving tip when decorating because if you found these already set up in the store, they would easily be $10 to $15. Maybe more depending on the size. But instead I spent about $10 on all of the frames that I got. Plus a few dollars on the digital downloads and they ended up looking super professional. Plus they're more customized than what you would often find at the stores. And another great thing about this is if you're doing something very specific, you can almost always find digital downloads or things like that, where it might be a little bit harder to find those super customized things in the store. As I'm starting the decorating process on Luke's new shelves, anything that I knew I wanted in a specific spot, I would start with those first and place those where I wanted them. And then with everything else, I'm just kind of filling in the gaps and placing those items more randomly and just seeing what fits where and what kind of looks right. I also wanted to add in not only decorative items, but also include some functioning pieces, so I'm including his football helmet that he wears each week to games and practices. This way it stores the helmet while also showing it off. He also has a football on display and that's the football that he plays with with his friends, along with more obvious things like an alarm clock and book. But don't overlook adding functional pieces like this as decor. You may be surprised what works as both decorative and functional. I also wanted to add in some of the things that I wanted in a particular spot, which I wanted in a particular spot, which I wanted in a particular spot, just to find ourselves before the life has by accidently died. It's a story, it's a light, it's a signal flying. It's kind of like something it likes, is a song it's an old, it's reflect- DAY. I keep so stanzin' through the sky and here you shine No backwards Actually you're right I know I was right, that's why I looked at it and said nope backwards No, I knew I was right It's not that I do have to say what you do I don't know if this happens to you but for me it never fails when we are minutes from finishing your project or a room It feels like the finish line feels extra far away as I lose steam But the last things that I wanted to do in Luke's bedroom before the big reveal to Luke was to put the bedding and pillowcases on and then finish it off with freshly vacuumed floors Oh So tell me you want me Tell me Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about the rug I found this rug months ago and I knew I had to snag it and hold on to it for Luke's bedroom It just looked so cool and totally became like the cherry on top of his bedroom makeover So Oh my gosh you guys this bedroom turned out even better than I had admission I love how classy it looks, how simple and functional it is It completely represents Luke and I'm so thankful to give him a space that's his that gives him function that he needs With the added bonus of it being his space that he can just hang out in and enjoy And I love that we were able to do it on a small budget If you look around we really didn't do anything to crazy yet It really doesn't feel like the same room that we started with just stays before you guys will have to let me know what your Favorite part of his bedroom ended up being I honestly don't even know if I have a favorite part like I love the bookshelves But I feel like that's very generalized.

        "transcription": " Yeah. All right. That's what you need in your audio. Ha! Oh! Brrr! Meow! Okay. Are you done? Are you done? I guess this is how we're starting to video. Welcome back you guys. Today we are back in the dog bedroom. If you guys have been keeping up on this very long journey, this has been a long bedroom makeover. Yeah, that's right. We've done a lot of work in here. We started with the floors. We did the doors. We painted. We added box trim. We painted the ceiling. We lost our bodies. We had it. Basically, we have done so much to this room and I am just so in love with the progress that we've made in here. It looks like a totally different space. It went from black to, hey, this is looking pretty cute, you know? And you know what? I will mention really quick to you guys. You know, we painted the one wall in here in the ceiling blue. And when I was asking you guys for your suggestions on paint colors, a lot of you were saying that dogs can see the color blue. And I was like, really? When did that pop up? I don't know, but I think that's really cute. It means that they can see your eyes, but not mine. Exactly. That's why they like me more than you. No, just kidding. Okay, so what we're gonna be working on today is, I'm gonna be doing a little semi-built in situation, fun thing on this wall. I don't even know how to explain it to you guys necessarily, but what we're gonna start with is, we have some IKEA bookshelves that we're going to build to basically start this little built-in, crazy idea that I have. When something organized and beautiful in this space, we've done so much to this space already that I wanna finish it out the right way. You know what I mean? We gotta do it justice. So I just wanna finish. And I know that you, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, So let's get building. I know that you love putting IKEA's furniture and stuff together. I know it's your favorite thing, so it's gonna be a fun day. We're gonna see if we're married by the end of it. Wait till the end to find out. Oh my gosh. There has to be an easier way. Yeah, you can. Okay. Now that we got that open in a very clean manner, okay? I think. I think. And look, it says don't be grumpy. You have to be happy when building it. Oh, okay. You have to know how to speak tools. That's what you're saying. You know how to speak tools. This guy says don't break it like an egg. And this one says fuse it to your arm. This one. One with the furniture. So you won with the furniture. That's a good one. This one he's thinking, but being grumpy and this guy is not thinking he's just calling IKEA's. He's like don't think you know what you can do. Like call IKEA. Call Mark, read head. And it's gonna be over for you. Yeah. You're wondering how do I break my femur? You do it by tapping pebs on top of your fingers. You go full force, force transferred, broken femur, broken knee. Perfect. And then you get out doing the project. Step one of Mark's tricks on how not to do work. Break a boat on purpose. Okay, I love the shelves. They're not going on this side of the wall, but I do think they're really cute. And I thought hey, I could build them from scratch, or I can just buy them at IKEA. And it's super cheap. These were $100 apiece. So $200. Not that bad. I cut down on labor time. Cut down on laborers. I mean, obviously it's not like, you know, your homemade real wood quality, but it's still really nice. And the most important thing is that I liked the color of them. So I do have doors that go in the front and then there's shelves that go in these two, which is really nice. So I didn't need like a ton of storage in this space. I just wanted something that looked really nice and would give me some storage. So yeah, so the doors are really cute. And I'm just hoping they're not broken because it kind of sounds like they might be. Oh, there's a glass front. Yeah, there's a glass front. And it kind of sounds like maybe the glass is broken. We're going to find out. Oh, that's easy. Woo! Okay, one is good. Cute! Yeah, it's just like- This is the hardware. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can't get through your way. You know I'm going to set a break every day. Cause I'm going to set a break. Yeah. I got all eyes on me. I got started. Not broken. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So here's where the bookshelves are going to live. And I love them. I feel like it's a perfect way to fill up this wall. And that's it guys. Thanks for coming. Just kidding. I really like the color of these. These are the Billy Bookcases from IKEA just so you guys know. And I was really impressed that I was able to mount the hardware on each side so they could open. Like you could mount the hardware over here if you wanted to and make it totally customizable to what you needed for the space. So I really like them. I'm impressed. I haven't put all the shelves in them. So they definitely have a lot more shelves which I felt like was really good storage. And yeah, they're going to look nice. So what I'm going to build between these is actually a little feeding station for the dogs down below. We have three dogs and they're big dogs. They have big bowls. And it's always been one of these things that I come into their room. There's bowls, there's the water bowls. And I just wanted a way to have them nicely displayed in here and have their dedicated little spot. That was definitely one of my goals putting this room back together. I didn't want it to feel cluttered like it used to. Slowly but surely we are cruising down the steps to be able to finish off this room. We've got a good day coming. And it's hot. The next day we headed to Home Depot to get all of our supplies to start building the dog bowl station. It's me, it's fucking up and up down. So there's shining over me. I got a good thing coming. It's crazy. So you can buy these are two by four foot sheets of plywood. And yes, they are a little bit more expensive. But marginally, like barely. No, they're a little bit more expensive. But I don't really care because I have to kind of like a full sheet of plywood which I don't really need an entire full sheet. It means I'm going to have less. I'm going to have more leftover in my shed that I don't want to store. And it's just more waste. So I'd rather piece together the exact materials that I need for this project instead of having like a bunch of waste leftover. And it'll be the same price either way because for three quarter inch plywood for a four by eight sheet, it's $100. So the cost of plywood, I feel like still hasn't really come down. It's better than it was a few years ago, but it's still not great. So I'm going to do this because it's a lot easier to work with, easier to cut down, and we'll be the same price really either way. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a Sometimes you have to let her go crazy in the wood aisle. Just let her just run around, look at all the wood. In the meantime, here's a fun joke. How do cows stay current? Or stay up to date on current events? They read the moves paper. I know you love it. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a Or like if you want to make like an airplane and fly away. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a Oh, there's a thunderstorm coming. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a Where do you kick your energy? It's like random bursts. Wait, does this make a thunderstorm? We can't buy it unless it makes a thunderstorm. He broke it. Oh no, it makes a wiggle sound. I mean, the weirdes. I hope the audio picked that up. They love you for it. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a Once we got home, I started measuring and drawing out my plans. I have a rule that if you can draw it, then you can definitely build it. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a Let's go. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a It's the next day and I'm getting ready to build this little center cubby thing here. The dog feeding station, whatever you want to call it. I'm very excited, but guess what's in my way? Guess what's in my way? A freaking outlet, okay? This room seems to be outlets are in the way. So there's this outlet down here. I don't want it to be there because I actually want to keep the outlet. So what I'm going to do is move it up. So I'm going to have a countertop here. And I think it'll be perfect to have an outlet right here. I know it's in the center, which is weird, but I don't really care. But at least I'll have a spot where I can plug in some little smell goods or something to keep this room smelling nice and fresh. With three dogs in here, that's a necessity. So yeah, so that should be really good. And all we have to do is just move it straight up. Seems pretty simple in theory, right? Right? It's going to be good. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a That's why you invest in your tools, folks. Okay. So I present to you all. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a That's why I'm going to have a spot where I can plug in some little smell goods. And I'm going to have a spot where I can plug in some little smell goods. And I'm going to have a spot where I can plug in some little smell goods. Yay! Perfect. It's amazing. Yay, we did it. Mission accomplished. I'm done for the day. I quit. This is great. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a After we got the outlet moved, it was time to start building the dog bowl station. I'm so excited to build this because it's actually been a while since I built something completely from scratch. I really enjoy the process of creating and seeing my vision come to life. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a That's why I'm going to have a spot where I can plug in some little smell goods. I'm just going to work how funny this is. So these are one by eight pieces of wood here and they're pre-primed. A lot of times when they're pre-primed, it kind of conceals what's going on underneath. Like how the manufacturing process actually works. So you can tell it's actually like two boards glued together in the center there probably. Two one by four. So you know, it's not probably the strongest situation. It works just fine for what we needed to do but you definitely wouldn't want to build a house with it. You're not screwing right in the middle of the board. Yeah, don't screw right in the middle of the board. It's holding splits. You can see exactly what's going on. So yeah. Alright, well we already did a start assembling. How easy is that? [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a I'm using my Craig Jig here to assemble everything. If you don't have a Craig Jig, you could totally just wood glue and nail everything together. But I love using my Craig Jig because I honestly just think it's fun. So I always opt to use it whenever I get the chance. It's also a really strong way to assemble something. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a I'm using my Craig Jig here to assemble everything. If you don't have a Craig Jig, you could easily use it. If you don't have a Craig Jig, you could easily use it. If you don't have a Craig Jig, you could easily use it. If you don't have a Craig Jig, you could easily use it. [\u266a OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [\u266a Okay you guys, it is the next day. And I'm feeling like we're having day job at it because we're going to cut down I bought another Laminate countertop for my Kia and it's the same one that we put in our office. And I loved it so much. It's so affordable. I mean, defiant affordable. It's like a hundred bucks for this slab thing. We're kind of going all out at this point. We're building. Bishop came up with the perfect name for it. I was like, what do I call this thing? And it's a dog bar. And I'm like, yes, that's so cute. Perfect. The dog bar deserves some foam larval. You know what I'm saying? So we have to cut this down and then we have to cut it in half as well. I am not slightly nervous at all. No. No. Yeah. It's just one of those things that you're like, oh, I don't want to mess it up. You know? I hate that feeling. But, I mean, isn't that how most projects are? It's like, I don't want to mess it up. But as my mom would say, there's more at the store. I guess I can. So we'll see how it goes. So the last time that we cut the laminate countertop, I had a different blade on it. And it left me with quite a few chips out of the top. That cut so smooth. Truly the blade that you have matters. Let's see how smooth it is. If it's a lot better this time. A few little chips. Still a few, but definitely better this last time. No, it's bad this last time. I mean, it cut a lot smoother. So we have a little bit of chips. So that's okay. Not too bad. Maybe I should try cutting from the underside. And see if that would leave me with less chips. I'm not sure. Probably. That's the other thing I have an experimented with. As you can imagine, you don't really experiment with cutting laminate every day. You know? We are, we are, we are, we are human. Stead and face and face. And we are, we are, we need the connection. A lads connect. And come together. Let's connect. Oh, let's connect. And stay connected. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's connect. Together. Oh, let's connect. Next up, I'm adding the laminate edge banding. And this is something I've never done before. So for some reason, I felt nervous. Even though it was extremely easy, once it dries, I will just shave off the excess with a razor blade. Then I needed to add a couple of supports to the bottom section of the dog bar so that I could screw the countertop to it. I also worked on adding the backing because I have something a little special. I want to add later on. So stay tuned for that. Oh, there's something good. Something to be done. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I saw the laminate. Oh, oh, oh. I'm feeling good like a facelift. Feeling like I can get on a cloud on a spaceship. I want to believe. Yeah, the sun's coming up in the basement. Only see the gold outside when it's raining. I want to believe. I'm going to end today's video here. I am loving the progress that we are making on this room. And you guys, I saved the best for last. So be sure to tune into the final reveal of this project next week where I share the reveal of the dog bar and the whole room put together. I can't wait for you guys to see it. Thank you for being here. And I will see you guys in the next video. Bye."
